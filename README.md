# Project title

"Exploration of Blink Rate as a Physiological Measure of Anxiety"

# Brief project overview

1) Our project focuses on a subset of data collected from parent-child dyads in the P-CAT R56 and P-CAT R01 studies, which consider the child and parent within a single interactive system and employs a developmentally-informed approach to understanding the role of the dyad in child psychopathology at the behavioral, psychophysiological, and neural levels.
2) We are specifically interested in the observed blink rates of parent-child dyads during a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test and whether said blink rates are correlated with self- and parent-reported measures of anxiety.
3) Our study includes both mothers and fathers. Child-focused studies generally have overwhelming maternal participation. By screening both parents when available and recruiting the parent with the higher level of anxiety, we will increase the recruitment of fathers. Our initial analyses can probe for initial signals of sex-linked differences, which has been designated as an area of need in pediatric research. Including both mothers and fathers will help to generalize parenting findings to both parents.
5) We are exploring these measures cross-sectionally, including 4-,  5-, and 6-year-old children. This is an ideal intervention window in which symptoms emerge but is often prior to psychiatric diagnosis.
